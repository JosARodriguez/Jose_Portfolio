## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/JosARodriguez/jose_portfolio/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Project 1: Location intelligence (Security cameras & Gasoline Stations)
#### Find the number of security cameras needed such that, given range of vision, they cover high criminality zones
* Created algorithm to find optimal locations for security cameras minimizing the number of cameras whilst covering the locations where past crimes had been reported.
* Proposed a loss function that would take into account the proximity of the cameras to each other as well as the distance from each camera to the location of crimes.
* Used different optimization techniques (Quasi-Newton methods, gradient descent, BFGS) to find good results considering time and computational power limitations.

#### Segment gasoline stations in Mexico in regions of 50 km. to assess the market in the different zones.
*

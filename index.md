# [Pricing Intelligence](https://github.com/JosARodriguez/jose_portfolio/blob/main/pricingIntelligence.pdf)
### Regression, Optimization, Data Manipulation

## Description 
* Process that gives a price recommendation for a gasoline station in order to maximize earnings considering: price of competitors, traffic information, price demand elasticity, a [forecast](https://github.com/JosARodriguez/jose_portfolio/blob/main/Forecast.ipynb) for the daily sales, etc. 

## Skills

* R ('tidyverse' with an emphasis on 'dplyr' and the base 'stats' package) for data wrangling and modeling regarding Linear Regression.
* Python (sci-kit learn and keras), for sales forecasting and as a bridge betweeen R and SQL for faster insertions to the database.
* RMarkdown and Excel for communicating results.
* SQL.

# Market segmentation
### Optimization, Data Manipulation, Classification and Clustering


## Description

* Segmentation of the ~13,000 gasoline stations in Mexico into ~1,500 20 km. radius zones in order to lower the number of API calls from data sources regarding fuel prices and traffic information to reduce costs to approximately a sixth of the original amount.
* Group gasoline stations by: predicted sales, level of competition, income level of location, etc. in order to recommend clients the most profitable regions to open or acquire a station.

## Skills

* R
* SQL
